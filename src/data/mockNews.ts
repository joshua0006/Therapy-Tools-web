    summary: 'A recent study published in the Journal of Speech-Language Pathology demonstrates significant gains in children who received early speech therapy intervention.',
    content: 'A groundbreaking study published last month in the Journal of Speech-Language Pathology has shown that children who receive speech therapy before the age of three show significantly better outcomes by kindergarten than those who start therapy later. The study, conducted over five years, followed 200 children with various speech and language disorders. According to lead researcher Dr. Maria Johnson, "Our findings strongly suggest that the neuroplasticity in these formative years allows for more effective therapy outcomes." The research team recommends that pediatricians screen for potential speech issues at 18-month well-child visits.',
